# Lottery Simulation Program aka Lottomachine

## Description
This program simulates a lottery game where the user can choose their own lottery numbers and see how they fare against a series of simulated lottery draws. The program provides a variety of features including calculating the probability of matching numbers, plotting the cumulative probability over multiple runs, and saving the results to a text file. Code comments in Finnish. 

## Features
- **User Input:** The program allows the user to input their own lottery numbers at the start of the game.
- **Lottery Draw:** The program simulates a lottery draw and checks the user’s numbers against the drawn numbers.
- **Probability Calculation:** The program calculates and displays the probability of the user’s numbers matching the drawn numbers.
- **Replay Option:** The program provides an option for the user to play again with the same numbers.
- **Cumulative Probability Plot:** The program plots the cumulative probability of matching numbers over multiple runs.
- **Save Results:** The program provides an option to save the results of each run to a text file.

## Usage
Please make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. To run the program, simply call the `main()` function from `lottomachinev3.py`. The program will guide you through the process of inputting your lottery numbers and starting the game. After each run, you will be given the option to play again, plot the results of 10 runs, or save the results to a text file.

## Dependencies
The program requires the following Python libraries:
- `time`
- `tkinter`
- `random`
- `math`
- `os` 
- `matplotlib.pyplot`


You can install libraries in Python 3 console with 

`pip install matplotlib`

Please ensure these libraries are installed before running the program.
